        As I learn more about front end web development, I decided to make this
        collection of vue components.<br />
        <br />
        I wanted to document my own components so that I can go back and look up
        how these work and how to use or modify them in the future.<br />
        <br />
        It is also my way of sharing what I have learnt and hopefully be useful
        to someone else. If you consider this to be the case, please support me
        by
        <a
          class="hover:text-teal-500 text-gray-800 font-semibold"
          href="https://ko-fi.com/topousuario"
          target="_blank"
          >donating</a
        >
        or sharing this content :)<br />
        <br />
        And because I think
        <a
          target="_blank"
          class="hover:text-teal-500 text-gray-800 font-semibold"
          href="https://tailwindcss.com/"
          >Tailwind CSS</a
        >
        is awesome, I style most of these components with it.
